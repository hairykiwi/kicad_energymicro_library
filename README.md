kicad_energymicro_library
=========================

For ease of maintenance, this KiCad schematic library for Energy Micro's EFM32 ARM Cortex MCUs is now co-located with the [csv2kicad](https://github.com/hairykiwi/csv2kicad) project - a multi-unit, (MCU) schematic component generating script.

As of July 2012 the library contains all 144 Energy Micro EFM32 devices.
